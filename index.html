          <li>Thorough cleaning (inside and out, if necessary).</li>
          <li>Unscented soaps and conditioners.</li> 
          <li>Sanitization and removal of mold and rust from toy interiors, if needed.</li>

        <p> 
          In 1982 Hasbro began production of My Little Pony, a brushable vinyl pastel horse that was small enough to take everywhere in your pocket and bring on adventures with you (this was after having started out with a large, hard plastic horse that had a trigger under the chin to blink the eyes and was known as "My Pretty Pony").</p> <br>
          <p> Over the many successful years of its existence, hundreds of unique and amazing varieties and types of ponies have been made, some only in one country or another. Today, both vintage and modernized versions of My Little Pony continue to garner popularity with children and adults alike.</p><br>
          <p> There are so many interesting types and beautiful varieties of My Little Ponies out there that it is truly exciting and wonderful to collect them. I still come across pony types I have never seen before. They are a world of beauty and they bring beauty into the world!
