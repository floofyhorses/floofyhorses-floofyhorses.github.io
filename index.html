<h2 >Focus on restoration</h2>
       <p>All toys in my store are carefully cleaned and restored, keeping them as original as possible. Anything that is added or changed, such as adding new hair or restoring a sea pony's rusty weight, is mentioned in the listing so you always know what you are getting.</p>
       

       <p>At sweetponysky, toys are lovingly prepared in a sanitized environment and stored safely in plastic to keep them clean and nice until they make their way home to you.</p>
     
          

    		      <h3 class="purple">Each toy I restore is like an old friend.</h3>
		          <p>I give each one individual care, including:</p>
        
		      <ul class="align">
		          <li class="bullets">Careful inspection and needs assessment to see how I can help them look and feel their best.</li>
		          <li class="bullets">Thorough cleaning - outside and inside if necessary.</li>
		          <li class="bullets">Unscented soaps and conditioners.</li> 
		          <li class="bullets">Sanitization and removal of mold and rust from toy interiors, if needed.</li>
		        </ul>
